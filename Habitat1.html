<h1>Polar Bear Habitat</h1>
<a href="Index.html">Back Home</a>
<p>Polar habitats are located at the very top and very bottom of the Earth. They are cold, windy and have a lot of snow and ice. It's even too cold for trees to grow</p>

     <h1>Killer Whale</h1>
<p>Killer whales are mostly black on top with white undersides and white patches near the eyes. They also have a gray or white saddle patch behind the dorsal fin. These markings vary widely between individuals and populations</p>

     <h1>Narwhale</h1>
<p>The narwhal looks like a cross between a whale and a unicorn with its long, spiraled tusk jutting from its head. Males most commonly have tusks, and some may even have two. The tusk, which can grow as long as 10 feet, is actually an enlarged tooth</p>
